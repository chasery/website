					<h2><span>About Ryan Chase and his many Web and Design abilities</span></h2>
				</div>
				<p>My name is Ryan Chase, I am a multifaceted designer and developer in Tigard, Oregon. Being skilled in Graphic Design and Web Development, I have a vast knowledge and experience spanning from Adobe Photoshop to XHTML. Over the last six years, I have honed my skills in this field and feel I would make an excellent addition to any team with my expertise and positive attitude. Currently I excel in XHTML, CSS, SEO, Adobe Photoshop, and am constantly evolving in digital photography as well as Adobe Illustrator.</p>
				<p>Six years ago I was introduced to Adobe Photoshop and I have not been able to put it down since. Quickly developing an interest in Graphic Design, I have built my portfolio in branding and web graphics through freelance and contract work. I feel that it is time to move on from freelance work to doing it every day, web design is what I want to do. I am a versatile addition to any team by understanding the requirements to work in either print or web based design.</p>
				<p>Being versatile is a quality that makes anything good, right? Along with my design skills, I am gaining a better grasp of the standards within the Web Development field. Constantly learning and developing new skills in this field, I have a solid understanding of CSS and XHTML. Over the last six months I have learned how to comfortably implement the jQuery Javascript library and its many different plugins. I feel that it is important to have an understanding of growing trends within the web world as it is constantly evolving. Having a working knowledge of DHTML and Ajax is a growing requirement for any modern website, it is for this reason that I have begun learning how to implement it. I hope to gain an opportunity to apply all of my skills in an environment where I am inspired to learn and grow, all while producing a product that makes the customer happy.</p>
